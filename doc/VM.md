# Virtual Machine

The virtual machine is a stack-based machine with 32-bit registers. It has a
small instruction set and a small number of registers. The virtual machine
supports 32-bit signed integers and 32-bit floating point numbers.

## Registers

The virtual machine has 8 general purpose registers that can
be treated as integer and floating point data types.

| Register | Description | Size |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| `r0`     | General purpose register | 64-bit |
| `r1`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r2`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r3`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r4`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r5`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r6`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
| `r7`     | General purpose register |64-bit |
